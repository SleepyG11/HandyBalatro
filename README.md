## Key features

-   **Vanilla-friendly**: no new run required; stability is priority, safe for use in base game and [Multiplayer](https://github.com/Balatro-Multiplayer/BalatroMultiplayer);
-   **Works without Steamodded**: but included supports for variety of different mods (NotJustYet, Nopeus, Cryptid);
-   **Fast hand selection**: highlight cards just by hovering them [(showcase)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPoW-uVKMt0);
-   **Keybinds for all vanilla buttons and actions**: play, discard, hand sorting, cash out, shop reroll, view deck, *and more*;
-   **Game speed**: adjust game speed up to x512 in-run;
-   **Animation skip**: instant scoring and removing unnecessary animations to speedup game even further [(showcase)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRxGXIhjW3s);
-   **Quick Buy/Sell/Use**: controls to buy, sell or use cards faster [(showcase)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1YnNI0W27k);
-   **Selection movement**: more precise management on large amoung of jokers or consumables [(showcase)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0wz5qP22CA);
-   **Full control**: each feature can be disabled/enabled individually, each keybind can be reassigned to any keyboard or mouse button;
-   **Gamepad support**: most features can be used with gamepad aswell;
-   **Presets**: save up to 3 mod settings layouts and switch between them in-run to have more freedom with limited amount of buttons;

## Danger zone

> [!CAUTION]
> This controls designed to be speed-first, which **can cause bugs, crashes or tank performance**!<br/>
> Also, their usage can lead to accidental cards selling or removing if do it not carefully!<br/>
> Hovewer, they're really useful for dealing with huge amount of Jokers, Consumables or Skip tags.<br/>
> Must be enabled separately. Use with caution.

-   **Sell cards in bulk**: all copies or ALL cards at once [(showcase)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE1R6xTKcaE);
-   **Removing**: deleting excessive jokers, consumables or __skip tags__;
-   **Max speed**: uncapped game speed and instant game animations;

> [!NOTE]
> REMOVE card or skip tag - delete without any checks, effects, triggers or money refunds.

## For developers

If your mod needs to disable Handy's dangerous controls on certain conditions, you can hook check function to do so:

```lua
if Handy and Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active then
    local funcRef = Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active
    function Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active()
        return funcRef() and not MyMod.only_safe_controls
    end
end
```

Similar for cases when needed to disable mod entirely:

```lua
if Handy and Handy.is_mod_active then
    local funcRef = Handy.is_mod_active
    function Handy.is_mod_active()
        return funcRef() and not MyMod.allow_only_vanilla_controls
    end
end
```

Also, specific feature's config can be overrided:

```lua
if Handy and Handy.get_module_override then
    local funcRef = Handy.get_module_override
    function Handy.get_module_override(module)
        if module == Handy.cc.speed_multiplier and not MyMod.allow_change_game_speed then
            return {
                enabled = false
            }
        end
        return funcRef(module)
    end
end
```

When adding new buy or use buttons for jokers/consumables, you can mark them and Handy will use them when [Quick Buy/Sell] or [Quick Use] is called.
Include in button config definition field `handy_insta_action` with one of the following values:
- `sell` for mass-sell features or when [Quick buy/sell] is used (aka Shift is hold); Use for "Sell" buttons;
- `buy_or_sell` when [Quick buy/sell] is used (aka Shift is hold); Use for "Buy" buttons;
- `use` when [Quick use] is used (aka Ctrl is hold); Use for "Use" buttons or buttons unique for your cards;

*Only difference between `sell` and `buy_or_sell` is for mass-sell features, since only selling is allowed for it.*

Example:
```lua
-- Somewhere inside `G.UIDEF.buy_and_sell_buttons()` hook

{
    n=G.UIT.R,
    config={
        -- ...your button definition
        button = 'buy_my_card', func = 'can_buy_my_card', handy_insta_action = 'buy_or_sell'
    },
    nodes={
        -- ...
    }
},
```
