## For developers

If your mod needs to disable Handy's dangerous controls on certain conditions, you can hook check function to do so:

```lua
if Handy and Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active then
    local funcRef = Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active
    function Handy.is_dangerous_actions_active()
        return funcRef() and not MyMod.only_safe_controls
    end
end
```

Similar for cases when needed to disable mod entirely:

```lua
if Handy and Handy.is_mod_active then
    local funcRef = Handy.is_mod_active
    function Handy.is_mod_active()
        return funcRef() and not MyMod.allow_only_vanilla_controls
    end
end
```
