# Handy - Balatro QoL controls mod

It's a small [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) mod that adds additional controls to Balatro.

## New Controls
- `Shift + LMB` on card to:
    - Buy joker, card, booster pack, voucher or consumable in shop
    - Select joker or card in booster pack
    - Sell joker in joker slots
    - Sell consumable in consumable slots
- `Ctrl + LMB` on card to:
    - Use consumable *(if possible)* in shop, booster pack or consumable slots
- `LMB` to select a card and then `Left/Right arrow` to:
    - Move highlight in direction between jokers or consumables

## TODO
- [ ] Open Run options on button hold
- [ ] Hold LMB to (de)select cards
